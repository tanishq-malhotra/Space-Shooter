Space Runner is a basic representation of the retro games that we have played in our childhood.

I have used the Turtle Graphics Module in Python to build this game.
Your basic aim is to hit all the player's.
Play with the tracer command(in line 11) to increase the speed of the game(depending on your system)
Game files - bg.gif, ememy.gif are used to add the corresponding image to the game.

#### HOW TO PLAY ###

Use the arrow keys to move the player.
UP --> To increase the speed.
DOWN --> To decrease the speed.
LEFT --> To turn left.
RIGHT --> To turn right.
